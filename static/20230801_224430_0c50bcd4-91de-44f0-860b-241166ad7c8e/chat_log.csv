Fluency and Coherence: Your responses were generally clear and coherent with some hesitation and self-correction, so I would rate you at Level 6.2. Vocabulary and Usage: Your vocabulary to discuss any given topics was adequate, but occasional incorrect word usage was noticed. The ability to paraphrase varied, so it puts you at Level 6 as well.3. Grammar Diversity and Accuracy: Basic and some complex sentence structures were used, although not always accurately. Regular grammar mistakes were noted but they did not lead to communication breakdowns. Therefore, you would receive Level 6 here too.4. Pronunciation: Pronunciation feature usage was mostly accurate with some instances of inaccuracy, which resulted in slight difficulty in understanding certain messages. This matches the criteria for Level 6.Upon averaging these scores, your overall speaking score for this oral examination would be a 6, which is considered average performance.
