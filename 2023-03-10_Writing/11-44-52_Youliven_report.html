	<ul>
		<li>explain why you enjoy living by the recreation ground</li>
		<li>describe the recent problems at the recreation ground</li>
		<li>say what you think the school should do.</li>

	<h2>Student Essay</h2>
	<p>Dear Headmaster,</p>
	<p>I am writing to express my appreciation for the use of the recreational ground in our community, as well as my concerns regarding the recent activities of some of your students.</p>
	<p>As a resident who frequently uses the recreational facilities, I feel privileged to live near such a beautiful and well-maintained area. It is a valuable resource for the whole community, and I appreciate the efforts of the school to utilize it for physical activities.</p>
	<p>However, I have noticed that the field has suffered some damage recently, particularly during wet weather. The students using the area for sports like football and cricket have caused large patches of mud and divots, which have become both unsightly and hazardous.</p>
	<p>To resolve this issue, I suggest that the school take responsibility for repairing the damage to the field. Additionally, guidance from school staff may be beneficial to prevent students from causing further damage in the future. Perhaps limiting the number of students who can use the field at one time or providing alternative playing locations on the school ground might be valuable.</p>
	<p>I believe that these changes can ensure that the recreational ground remains an accessible and safe environment for everyone in the community to enjoy. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,<br>
	[Your Name]</p>

	<p>Dear Mr. Johnson,</p>
	<p>I am writing to express my gratitude for the presence of the recreational ground in our locality, and to bring to your attention some issues that have arisen with the use of the area by your school pupils.</p>
	<p>As someone who frequently uses the field for exercise and relaxation, I find it to be an integral and valuable component of the community. It is always delightful to see students from your school engaging in sports like football and cricket while utilizing the natural beauty of the field.</p>
	<p>However, with the rainy season upon us, the condition of the field has been deteriorating. The repeated use of the area by a large number of students has resulted in significant wear and tear damage, such as holes in the ground and patches of mud. This renders it difficult and unsafe to use the recreational ground for any physical activity.</p>
	<p>To rectify this issue, I suggest that your school take responsibility for maintaining the field in good condition. I would be grateful if the school could allocate some funding towards its maintenance, such as resurfacing it with a material that would withstand the inclement weather conditions. Your staff may also be able to help by assessing and repairing the current damage, as well as supervising students to ensure that rules regarding safety and care of the facilities are being adhered to.</p>
	<p>I hope that this issue can be resolved soon, as the recreational ground is an irreplaceable asset to the community. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,<br>
	[Your Name]</p>
