		<h2>Student Essay</h2>
		<p>Dear Headmaster,</p>
		<p>I am writing to express my appreciation for the use of the recreational ground in our community, as well as my concerns regarding the recent activities of some of your students.</p>
		<p>As a resident who frequently uses the recreational facilities, I feel privileged to live near such a beautiful and well-maintained area. It is a valuable resource for the whole community, and I appreciate the efforts of the school to utilize it for physical activities.</p>
		<p>However, I have noticed that the field has suffered some damage recently, particularly during wet weather. The students using the area for sports like football and cricket have caused large patches of mud and divots, which have become both unsightly and hazardous.</p>
		<p>To resolve this issue, I suggest that the school take responsibility for repairing the damage to the field. Additionally, guidance from school staff may be beneficial to prevent students from causing further damage in the future. Perhaps limiting the number of students who can use the field at one time or providing alternative playing locations on the school ground might be valuable.</p>
		<p>I believe that these changes can ensure that the recreational ground remains an accessible and safe environment for everyone in the community to enjoy. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,<br>[Your Name]</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>Dear Headmaster,</p>
		<p>I am writing to express my appreciation for the recreational ground in our community, which serves as an excellent location for physical activities, not only for the students in your school but for the entire community. Nonetheless, I would like to bring your attention to some recent issues that need to be addressed.</p>
		<p>The severe damages caused to the recreational ground due to the heavy usage by students led to my concern. The turf has become patchy, unsightly, and has increased the risk of injury. Although I recognize the importance of physical activities for students, I believe that this cannot be at the expense of communal recreational areas.</p>
		<p>To resolve these problems, I propose two solutions. Firstly, the school can assign a groundkeeper to maintain the condition of the recreational ground. With proper care, the field will remain in a much better state. Secondly, with proper management, the school can set designated areas for specific sports, and it can limit the number of students who can use the area at one time adequately.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, I believe that by addressing these issues, we can preserve the recreational ground as a valuable resource for the community, and ensure the continued use of the facility without creating any problems. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,<br>[Your name]</p>
